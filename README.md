# Dumb as a Mug
Originally a webcomic made with a webcomic CMS built with PHP in the early 2010's, I've rebuilt this using Gatsby and DatoCMS. 

## Goals
My first goal was to build something that the author could maintain himself without needing me. Flexible enough to be an archive for his work using Jamstack, but also expand in case he wanted to add any more comics. 

## Tech Stack
I originally thought about using 11ty for a very stripped down experience. But Gatsby is just too enjoyable to work in.

For the CMS I considered Markdown files and S3 to hold the comics, but datoCMS had everything needed and I didn't have to make too many compromizes to get it up and running for the author.
